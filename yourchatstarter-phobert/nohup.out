Some weights of the model checkpoint at ./phobert-base/pytorch_model.bin were not used when initializing RobertaForSequenceClassification: ['roberta.pooler.dense.weight', 'roberta.pooler.dense.bias', 'lm_head.dense.weight', 'lm_head.decoder.bias', 'lm_head.bias', 'lm_head.layer_norm.weight', 'lm_head.layer_norm.bias', 'lm_head.decoder.weight', 'lm_head.dense.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing RobertaForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing RobertaForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of RobertaForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at ./phobert-base/pytorch_model.bin and are newly initialized: ['classifier.out_proj.bias', 'classifier.dense.weight', 'classifier.out_proj.weight', 'classifier.dense.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
